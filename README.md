# React Router Dom v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render their components even when the URL path matches. The parent route renders correctly, but its children don't.  This repository provides both a reproduction of the bug and a solution.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the buggy implementation.  Observe that the nested routes within the parent route do not render correctly.  This issue can manifest in different ways depending on the structure of the application and other factors.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file showcases a corrected implementation. The solution typically involves carefully examining the route structure, ensuring correct path definitions, and potentially making adjustments to the component hierarchy.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Troubleshooting
If you're encountering a similar issue, consider the following:
* **Check your path definitions:**  Make sure the paths in your `Route` components are accurate and match the URLs you're trying to navigate to.
* **Review component hierarchy:**  Ensure the nested routes are properly nested within the parent route components.
* **Inspect React Router configuration:** Verify that React Router is correctly set up and configured in your application.
* **Look for conflicting route definitions:** Check for any potential conflicts or overlaps between different route definitions.
